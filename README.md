## Powerful backend. Thoughtfully designed.

I build backend systems the way Apple builds products —  
**simple on the surface, deeply engineered underneath**.

My focus is on clean APIs, strong architecture, and systems that scale quietly and reliably.

---

## Why backend?

Because performance matters.  
Because reliability matters.  
Because great user experiences depend on systems you never see.

---

## What I build

- Scalable backend services  
- Clean, predictable REST APIs  
- Database-driven system design  
- Cloud-native architectures  
- Maintainable, readable codebases

## Designed to last.

Each repository here focuses on solving **real problems** —  
not demo-only code, not unnecessary abstractions.

Just systems designed to work — and keep working.

---

## Currently exploring

- Distributed systems  
- Backend performance optimization  
- Cloud architecture patterns  

---


## Philosophy

> Simplicity is not the absence of complexity.  
> It is the result of mastering it.
